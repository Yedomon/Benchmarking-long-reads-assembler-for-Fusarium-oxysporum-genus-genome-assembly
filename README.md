The state-of-art in genomics field for plastic waste management relied on the comprehension of the microorganisms interactions with the polymers. The general principle of a biodegradation of a polymer can be summarized in the "attach-grow-degrade" maner <sup>[[1]]()</sup>. Depending on the environment, the polymers biodegradation can occur under aerobic, anerobic or partial aerobic conditions <sup>[[2]]()</sup>. In fact, polymers degrade naturally under aerobic conditions. However, in landfill or sediment, the biodegration process is performed under anaerobic conditions. In the case of organic substrate such as soil and compost, the degration rely on a partial aerobic conditions.


Among microorganisms that are involved un the polymers degradation, bacterial and fungal types are the most reported <sup>[[3]]()</sup>. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technology enables to decifer the functionnal bioprocesses related to plastic biodegradation.
